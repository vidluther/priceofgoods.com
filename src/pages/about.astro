        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        I wanted to see if the price of goods I consume was going up or down.
        I have a feeling that prices aren't going to go down below Pandemic levels ever again.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        But who knows, hopefully I'm wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        I figured other people may care too, so I built this site. If you have a specific product you want to track prices for, let me know
        or better yet <a href="https://github.com/vidluther/priceofgoods.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"> create a PR on Github </a>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">About the Data</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          I source all the data directly from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
          <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/tools.htm" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"> Data Tools </a>.
          </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong> It's important to note the BLS only updates their figures monthly, not
          in real-time. This means the prices you see reflect official government statistics rather than day-to-day
          retail prices you might see at your local store. </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The prices shown are national and regional averages, and actual prices in your area may vary.
          Thanks to the BLS API, I can provide historical price data going back twenty years.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Data Updates</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
        I poll the BLS API once a day, but the BLS will update it's data whenever it updates it's data. I try to make it obvious when the data was last updated.
